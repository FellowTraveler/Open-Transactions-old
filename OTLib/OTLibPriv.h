 *   This program is free software: you can redistribute it
 *   and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero
 *   General Public License as published by the Free Software
 *   Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your
 *   option) any later version.
 *    
 *   ADDITIONAL PERMISSION under the GNU Affero GPL version 3
 *   section 7: (This paragraph applies only to the LAGPLv3
 *   components listed above.) If you modify this Program, or
 *   any covered work, by linking or combining it with other
 *   code, such other code is not for that reason alone subject
 *   to any of the requirements of the GNU Affero GPL version 3.
 *   (==> This means if you are only using the OT-API, then you
 *   don't have to open-source your code--only your changes to
 *   Open Transactions itself must be open source. Similar to
 *   LGPLv3, except it applies to software-as-a-service, not
 *   just to distributing binaries.)
 *
 *   Extra WAIVER for OpenSSL, Lucre, and all other libraries
 *   used by Open Transactions: This program is released under
 *   the AGPL with the additional exemption that compiling,
 *   linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed. The same is true
 *   for any other open source libraries included in this
 *   project: complete waiver from the AGPL is hereby granted to
 *   compile, link, and/or use them with Open Transactions,
 *   according to their own terms, as long as the rest of the
 *   Open Transactions terms remain respected, with regard to
 *   the Open Transactions code itself.
 *    
 *   Lucre License:
 *   This code is also "dual-license", meaning that Ben Lau-
 *   rie's license must also be included and respected, since
 *   the code for Lucre is also included with Open Transactions.
 *   See Open-Transactions/OTLib/Lucre/LUCRE_LICENSE.txt
 *   The Laurie requirements are light, but if there is any
 *   problem with his license, simply remove the Lucre code.
 *   Although there are no other blind token algorithms in Open
 *   Transactions (yet. credlib is coming), the other functions
 *   will continue to operate.

 *   software license, please contact FellowTraveler.

 *   so who could really stop them?)
