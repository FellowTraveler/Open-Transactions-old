The Open-Transactions project is a collaborative effort to develop
a robust, commercial-grade, fully-featured, free-software toolkit
implementing the OTX protocol as well as a full-strength financial
cryptography library, API, CLI, and prototype server. The project
is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the
Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the Open-Transactions
toolkit and its related documentation.

Please see the official wiki:

Open-Transactions democratizes financial and monetary actions. You
can use it for issuing currencies/stock, paying dividends, creating
asset accounts, sending/receiving digital cash, writing/depositing
cheques, cashier's cheques, creating basket currencies, trading on
markets, scripting custom agreements, recurring payments, escrow,
etc.

Open-Transactions uses strong crypto. The balances are unchangeable
(even by a malicious server.) The receipts are destructible and
redundant. The transactions are unforgeable. The cash is untraceable.
The cheques are non-repudiable. Etc.

This product includes software developed by Ben Laurie for use in
the Lucre project.
