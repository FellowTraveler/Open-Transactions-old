 DISCARD A CHEQUE  -- returns OT_TRUE or OT_FALSE
 
 When you write a cheque, your wallet software must use one of your transaction
 numbers on the cheque. Even when you give the cheque to someone, a good wallet
 should still store a copy of the cheque, until it is cashed.
 This way, if you decide to "tear it up" (perhaps the recipient left the country!)
 then you will still have a copy of the cheque, and you can get your transaction
 number back before discarding it.
 
 Why does it matter to get the transaction number back?  Because once you sign
 that number out, you will have to CONTINUE signing it out on EVERY RECEIPT until
 that transaction is finally closed out. You are still responsible for that 
 transaction number, until then.
 
 So most likely, if the cheque is going nowhere, then you will want to RETRIEVE
 the transaction number back from the cheque so you can use it on another transaction
 instead.  *THIS* IS THE FUNCTION YOU SHOULD USE TO DO THAT!!!!

 PROPOSE PAYMENT PLAN  --- Returns the payment plan in string form.
 
 (Called by Merchant.)

 PARAMETER NOTES:
 -- Payment Plan Delay, and Payment Plan Period, both default to 30 days (if you pass 0.)

 -- Payment Plan Length, and Payment Plan Max Payments, both default to 0, which means
    no maximum length and no maximum number of payments.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 FYI, the payment plan creation process (finally) is:

 1) Payment plan is written, and signed, by the recipient. (This function: OT_API_ProposePaymentPlan)
 2) He sends it to the sender, who signs it and submits it. (OT_API_ConfirmPaymentPlan and OT_API_depositPaymentPlan)
 3) The server loads the recipient nym to verify the transaction
    number. The sender also had to burn a transaction number (to
    submit it) so now, both have verified trns#s in this way.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FYI, here are all the OT library calls that are performed by this single API call:

										  pAccount->GetAssetTypeID(),
										  pAccount->GetRealAccountID(),	pAccount->GetUserID(),

/*
 OT_API_Msg_HarvestTransactionNumbers
 
 This function will load up the cron item (which is either a market offer, a payment plan,
 or a SMART CONTRACT.)  UPDATE: this function operates on messages, not cron items.
 
 Then it will try to harvest all of the closing transaction numbers for NYM_ID that are
 available to be harvested from THE_CRON_ITEM. (There might be zero #s available for that
 Nym, which is still a success and will return true. False means error.)
 
 YOU MIGHT ASK:
 
 WHY WOULD I WANT to harvest ONLY the closing numbers for the Nym, and not the OPENING
 numbers as well? The answer is because for this Nym, the opening number might already
 be burned. For example, if Nym just tried to activate a smart contract, and the activation
 FAILED, then maybe the opening number is already gone, even though his closing numbers, on the
 other hand, are still valid for retrieval. (I have to double check this.)
 
 HOWEVER, what if the MESSAGE failed, before it even TRIED the transaction? In which case,
 the opening number is still good also, and should be retrieved.  
 
 Remember, I have to keep signing for my transaction numbers until they are finally closed out.
 They will appear on EVERY balance agreement and transaction statement from here until the end
 of time, whenever I finally close out those numbers. If some of them are still good on a failed
 transaction, then I want to retrieve them so I can use them, and eventually close them out.
 
 ==> Whereas, what if I am the PARTY to a smart contract, but I am not the actual ACTIVATOR / ORIGINATOR
 (who activated the smart contract on the server).  Therefore I never sent any transaction to the
 server, and I never burned my opening number. It's probably still a good #. If my wallet is not a piece
 of shit, then I should have a stored copy of any contract that I signed. If it turns out in the future
 that that contract wasn't activated, then I can retrieve not only my closing numbers, but my OPENING
 number as well! IN THAT CASE, I would call OT_API_HarvestAllNumbers() instead of OT_API_HarvestClosingNumbers().

 // -----------------
 
 UPDATE: The above logic is now handled automatically in OT_API_HarvestTransactionNumbers.
 Therefore OT_API_HarvestClosingNumbers and OT_API_HarvestAllNumbers have been removed.

-- (1) gets added to recipient's Nymbox as "in ref to" string on a "instrumentNotice" transaction.
-- When recipient processes Nymbox, the "instrumentNotice" transaction (containing (1) in its "in ref to"
   field) is copied and added to the recipient's paymentInbox.
-- When recipient iterates through paymentInbox transactions, they are ALL "instrumentNotice"s. Each 
   transaction contains an OTMessage in its "in ref to" field, and that OTMessage object contains an 
   encrypted payload of the instrument itself (an OTPayment object containing a cheque or payment plan
   or invoice etc.)
-- When sender gets Outpayments contents, the original instrument (inside an OTPayment) is stored IN THE 
   CLEAR as payload on an OTMessage.

THEREFORE:
TO EXTRACT INSTRUMENT FROM PAYMENTS INBOX:
-- Iterate through the transactions in the payments inbox.
-- (They should all be "instrumentNotice" transactions.)
-- Each transaction contains (1) OTMessage in "in ref to" field, which in turn contains an encrypted
   OTPayment in the payload field, which then contains the instrument itself.
-- *** Therefore, this function, based purely on ledger index (as we iterate) extracts the

// *** MESSAGES BEING SENT TO THE SERVER -- BELOW!!! ***




/**
 CHECK SERVER ID  -- (This is used for "pinging" the server...)
 
 Notice, if you ever want to send a message, you have to include the
 Server ID and the User ID.
 
 The OTAPI will use the Server ID to look-up the server contract. (FYI,
 the Server ID is a hash of the server contract itself, so it is impos-
 sible to change the contract, without also changing the ID.)
 
 Then it will connect to the server based on the connection information
 in that contract, send the message, get the reply, and disconnect. 
 (That's in HTTP mode -- in TCP mode it maintains the connection.)
 
 It will also encrypt the message to the public key found inside that
 contract, so only the person who signed the contract will be able to
 read the message.
 
 Open Transactions will also use the User ID to lookup the public key
 for that user. (The UserID, aka NymID, is a hash of the public key
 itself.)
 
 This message is basically just a ping -- it verifies that the server
 is really there, and that it can really open the messages that are
 encrypted to the key in the server contract.  It's the first thing
 your wallet software should do. Think of it like a way to PING the
 server.

/**
 CREATE USER's ACCOUNT  (On a specific server.)
 
 Note: There are USER accounts and ASSET accounts...
 
 A User account is simply a public key. Whenever you send a message
 to the server, you would normally have to send a public key with the
 message, so that the server can encrypt the reply back to you.
 
 Due to this, the server will cache the public key so you only have
 to send the ID (which is a hash of the key.) The server uses this ID
 to look up the public key and encrypt the response back to you.
 
 -- Any user can create as many public keys as they wish. So User
	accounts are pseudonymous.
 
 -- Cash token exchanges are possible without a User account (using
	an HTTPS proxy operated by the server operator) so users are NOT
    forced to create accounts, if they prefer to deal only in cash.
    However, it's worth noting that even if they do, the cash itself
    IS STILL UNTRACEABLE, due to the Chaumian blinding.
 
 -- A user may use the same public key at multiple servers, and he
    creates his own keys inside the wallet. So this function is less
    about "creating" the user account, and more about simply register-
    ing a public key on a specific server.  
 
 -- (Wallet software is capable, in OT, of distributing assets across
	multiple servers seamlessly, which means it's a requirement that
    the user generate his own keys and register them on whichever 
    servers that he sees fit to trust.
 
 Since the server contract and public key are both presumed to have
 been created by this point, you simply pass in their IDs and the
 library will do the rest of the work.

 You might ask: Doesn't this mean that ANY user can get/set the usage credits for any other??

 causing your transaction to fail.)
 
 -- Then you call OT_API_LoadInbox to load it from local storage.
 
 During this time, your user has the opportunity to peruse the
 inbox, and to decide which transactions therein he wishes to 
 accept or reject.  If you want to display the inbox items on
 the screen, use these functions to loop through them:
 OT_API_Ledger_GetCount
 OT_API_Ledger_GetTransactionByIndex
 OT_API_Ledger_GetTransactionIDByIndex
 
 You will probably ask me for more introspection on the transactions themselves. 
 (Just ask -- No problem.)  Here's what you have right now:
 OT_API_Transaction_GetType
 
 -- Then call OT_API_Ledger_CreateResponse in order to create a
 'response' ledger for that inbox, which will be sent to the server.
 
 -- Then call OT_API_Ledger_GetCount (pass it the inbox) to find out how many 
 transactions are inside of it.  Use that count to LOOP through them...
 
 -- Use OT_API_Ledger_GetTransactionByIndex to grab each transaction as
 you iterate through the inbox.
 
 -- Call OT_API_Transaction_CreateResponse to create a response for each
 transaction, accepting or rejecting it, and adding it to the response
 ledger.
  
 -- Penultimately, call OT_API_Ledger_FinalizeResponse() which will create
 a Balance Agreement for the ledger.
 
 -- Finally, call OT_API_processInbox to send that response ledger to the
 server and process the various items.
