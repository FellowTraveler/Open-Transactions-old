	have to do anything to update all the Nyms, since that part hasn't changed.

	But we might want a separate "Change Master Key" function that replaces that key
	itself, in which case we'd HAVE to load up all the Nyms and re-save them.

	UPDATE: Seems the easiest thing to do is to just change both the key and passphase
	at the same time here, by loading up all the private nyms, destroying the master key,
	and then saving all the private Nyms. (With master key never actually being "paused.")
	This will automatically cause it to generate a new master key during the saving process.

	This way, if you decide to "tear it up" (perhaps the recipient left the country!)

	number back before discarding it.

	Why does it matter to get the transaction number back? Because once you sign
	that number out, you will have to CONTINUE signing it out on EVERY RECEIPT until
	that transaction is finally closed out. You are still responsible for that 
	transaction number, until then.

	So most likely, if the cheque is going nowhere, then you will want to RETRIEVE
	the transaction number back from the cheque so you can use it on another transaction
	instead. *THIS* IS THE FUNCTION YOU SHOULD USE TO DO THAT!!!!

	PARAMETER NOTES:
	-- Payment Plan Delay, and Payment Plan Period, both default to 30 days (if you pass 0.)

	-- Payment Plan Length, and Payment Plan Max Payments, both default to 0, which means
	no maximum length and no maximum number of payments.

	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	FYI, the payment plan creation process (finally) is:

	1) Payment plan is written, and signed, by the recipient. (This function: ProposePaymentPlan)
	2) He sends it to the sender, who signs it and submits it. (ConfirmPaymentPlan and depositPaymentPlan)
	3) The server loads the recipient nym to verify the transaction
	number. The sender also had to burn a transaction number (to
	submit it) so now, both have verified trns#s in this way.

	FYI, here are all the OT library calls that are performed by this single API call:

	OTPaymentPlan * pPlan = new OTPaymentPlan(pAccount->GetRealServerID(), 
	pAccount->GetAssetTypeID(),
	pAccount->GetRealAccountID(),	pAccount->GetUserID(),

	Msg_HarvestTransactionNumbers

	This function will load up the cron item (which is either a market offer, a payment plan,
	or a SMART CONTRACT.) UPDATE: this function operates on messages, not cron items.

	Then it will try to harvest all of the closing transaction numbers for NYM_ID that are
	available to be harvested from THE_CRON_ITEM. (There might be zero #s available for that
	Nym, which is still a success and will return true. False means error.)

	YOU MIGHT ASK:

	WHY WOULD I WANT to harvest ONLY the closing numbers for the Nym, and not the OPENING
	numbers as well? The answer is because for this Nym, the opening number might already
	be burned. For example, if Nym just tried to activate a smart contract, and the activation
	FAILED, then maybe the opening number is already gone, even though his closing numbers, on the
	other hand, are still valid for retrieval. (I have to double check this.)

	HOWEVER, what if the MESSAGE failed, before it even TRIED the transaction? In which case,
	the opening number is still good also, and should be retrieved. 

	Remember, I have to keep signing for my transaction numbers until they are finally closed out.
	They will appear on EVERY balance agreement and transaction statement from here until the end
	of time, whenever I finally close out those numbers. If some of them are still good on a failed
	transaction, then I want to retrieve them so I can use them, and eventually close them out.

	==> Whereas, what if I am the PARTY to a smart contract, but I am not the actual ACTIVATOR / ORIGINATOR
	(who activated the smart contract on the server). Therefore I never sent any transaction to the
	server, and I never burned my opening number. It's probably still a good #. If my wallet is not a piece
	of shit, then I should have a stored copy of any contract that I signed. If it turns out in the future
	that that contract wasn't activated, then I can retrieve not only my closing numbers, but my OPENING
	number as well! IN THAT CASE, I would call HarvestAllNumbers() instead of HarvestClosingNumbers().

	// -----------------

	UPDATE: The above logic is now handled automatically in HarvestTransactionNumbers.
	Therefore HarvestClosingNumbers and HarvestAllNumbers have been removed.

	/**
	CHECK SERVER ID -- (This is used for "pinging" the server...)

	Notice, if you ever want to send a message, you have to include the
	Server ID and the User ID.

	The OTAPI will use the Server ID to look-up the server contract. (FYI,
	the Server ID is a hash of the server contract itself, so it is impos-
	sible to change the contract, without also changing the ID.)

	Then it will connect to the server based on the connection information
	in that contract, send the message, get the reply, and disconnect. 
	(That's in HTTP mode -- in TCP mode it maintains the connection.)

	It will also encrypt the message to the public key found inside that
	contract, so only the person who signed the contract will be able to
	read the message.

	Open Transactions will also use the User ID to lookup the public key
	for that user. (The UserID, aka NymID, is a hash of the public key
	itself.)

	This message is basically just a ping -- it verifies that the server
	is really there, and that it can really open the messages that are
	encrypted to the key in the server contract. It's the first thing
	your wallet software should do. Think of it like a way to PING the

	/**
	CREATE USER's ACCOUNT (On a specific server.)

	Note: There are USER accounts and ASSET accounts...

	A User account is simply a public key. Whenever you send a message
	to the server, you would normally have to send a public key with the
	message, so that the server can encrypt the reply back to you.

	Due to this, the server will cache the public key so you only have
	to send the ID (which is a hash of the key.) The server uses this ID
	to look up the public key and encrypt the response back to you.

	-- Any user can create as many public keys as they wish. So User
	accounts are pseudonymous.

	-- Cash token exchanges are possible without a User account (using
	an HTTPS proxy operated by the server operator) so users are NOT
	forced to create accounts, if they prefer to deal only in cash.
	However, it's worth noting that even if they do, the cash itself
	IS STILL UNTRACEABLE, due to the Chaumian blinding.

	-- A user may use the same public key at multiple servers, and he
	creates his own keys inside the wallet. So this function is less
	about "creating" the user account, and more about simply register-
	ing a public key on a specific server. 

	-- (Wallet software is capable, in OT, of distributing assets across
	multiple servers seamlessly, which means it's a requirement that
	the user generate his own keys and register them on whichever 
	servers that he sees fit to trust.

	Since the server contract and public key are both presumed to have
	been created by this point, you simply pass in their IDs and the
	library will do the rest of the work.

	Transaction_GetType

	-- Then call Ledger_CreateResponse in order to create a
	'response' ledger for that inbox, which will be sent to the server.

	-- Then call Ledger_GetCount (pass it the inbox) to find out how many 
	transactions are inside of it. Use that count to LOOP through them...

	-- Use Ledger_GetTransactionByIndex to grab each transaction as
	you iterate through the inbox.

	-- Call Transaction_CreateResponse to create a response for each
	transaction, accepting or rejecting it, and adding it to the response
	ledger.

	-- Penultimately, call Ledger_FinalizeResponse() which will create
	a Balance Agreement for the ledger.

	-- Finally, call processInbox to send that response ledger to the
