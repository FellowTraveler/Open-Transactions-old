  The PAYMENT can be of types:
    - CHEQUE, INVOICE, VOUCHER (these are all forms of cheque)
    - PAYMENT PLAN, SMART CONTRACT (these are cron items)
    - PURSE (containing cash)
 
 FYI:
 // ----------------------
 OTContract — Most other classes are derived from this one. Contains the actual XML contents,
  as well as various data values that were loaded from those contents, including public keys.
  Also contains a list of signatures.
 // ----------------------
 OTScriptable — Derived from OTContract, but enables scriptable clauses. Also contains a list
  of parties (each with agents and asset accounts) as well as a list of bylaws (each with scripted
  clauses, internal state, hooks, callbacks, etc.)
 // ----------------------
 OTInstrument — Has a date range, a server ID, and an asset ID. Derived from OTScriptable.
 // ----------------------
 OTTrackable  — Has a transaction number, user ID, and an asset account ID. Derived from OTInstrument.
 // ----------------------
 OTCheque — A financial instrument. Derived from OTTrackable.
 // ----------------------
 OTCronItem — Derived from OTTrackable. OT has a central “Cron” object which runs recurring tasks, known as CronItems.
 // ----------------------
 OTAgreement — Derived from OTCronItem. It has a recipient and recipient asset account.
 // ----------------------
 OTPaymentPlan — Derived from OTAgreement, derived from OTCronItem. Allows merchants and customers
  to set up recurring payments. (Cancel anytime, with a receipt going to both inboxes.)
 // ----------------------
 OTSmartContract — Derived from OTCronItem. All CronItems are actually derived from OTScriptable already
  (through OTTrackable/OTInstrument). But OTSmartContract is the first/only Cron Item specifically designed
  to take full advantage of both the cron system AND the scriptable system in conjunction with each other.
  Currently OTSmartContract is the only actual server-side scripting on OT.
