 *   Extra WAIVER for OpenSSL, Lucre, and all other libraries

 *   the Open-Transactions code itself.
 *
 *   Lucre License:
 *   This code is also "dual-license", meaning that Ben Lau-
 *   rie's license must also be included and respected, since
 *   the code for Lucre is also included with Open Transactions.
 *   See Open-Transactions/src/otlib/lucre/LUCRE_LICENSE.txt
 *   The Laurie requirements are light, but if there is any
 *   problem with his license, simply remove the Lucre code.
 *   Although there are no other blind token algorithms in Open
 *   Transactions (yet. credlib is coming), the other functions
 *   will continue to operate.

// The purpose of this class is to cache server replies (internally to OT)

// 
// This class is pretty generic and so may be used as an output buffer
// as well. (If "stack" form is preferable.)

// OUTOING MESSAGES (from me--client--sent to server.)


// The purpose of this class is to cache client requests (being sent to the server)
// so that they can later be queried (using the request number) by the developer
// using the OTAPI, so that if transaction numbers need to be clawed back from failed
// messages, etc, they are available.
//
// The OT client side also can use this as a mechanism to help separate old-and-dealt-with
// messages, by explicitly removing messages from this queue once they are dealt with.
// This way the developer can automatically assume that any reply is old if it carries
// a request number that cannot be found in this queue.
//
// This class is pretty generic and so may be used in other ways, where "map"
// functionality is required.
