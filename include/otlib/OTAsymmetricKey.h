    // and we're going to destroy it when we're done with it.  2. A timer
    // is running, and until the 10 minutes are up, the private key is available.
    // But: Presumably it's stored in PROTECTED MEMORY, either with specific
    // tricks used to prevent swapping and to zero after we're done, and to 
    // prevent core dumps, or it's stored in ssh-agent or some similar standard
    // API (gpg-agent, keychain Mac Keychain, etc) or Windows protected memory
    // etc etc. Inside OT I can also give the option to go with our own security
    // tricks (listed above...) or to keep the timer length at 0, forcing the
    // password to be entered over and over again. IDEA: When the user enters
    // the passphrase for a specific Nym, hash it (so your plaintext passphrase isn't
    // stored in memory anywhere) and then USE that hash as the passphrase on 
    // the actual key. (Meaning also that the user will not be able to use his
    // passphrase outside of OT, until he EXPORTS the Nym, since he would also have
    // to hash the passphrase before manipulating the raw key file.)
    // At this point, we have the hash of the user's passphrase, which is what we
    // actually use for opening his private key (which is also normally kept in
    // an encrypted form, on the hard drive AND in RAM!!) So everything from above
    // still applies: I don't want to reveal that hash, so I store it using tricks
    // to secure the memory (I have to do this part anyway, ANYTIME I touch certain
    // forms of data), or in ssh-agent, and so on, except a timer can be set after
    // the user first enters his passphrase. For ultimate security, just set the
    // timer to 0 and type your passphrase every single time. But instead let's 
    // say you set it to 10 minutes. I don't want to store that password hash,
    // either. (The hash protects the plaintext password, but the hash IS the ACTUAL
    // password, so while the plaintext PW is protected, the actual one is still not.)
    // Therefore I will select some random data from OpenSSL for use as a TEMPORARY
    // password, a session key, and then encrypt all the hashes to that session key.
    // This way, the actual passphrases (hashed version) do NOT appear in memory, AND
    // NEITHER DO the plaintext versions! You might ask, well then why not just encrypt
    // the plaintext passphrase itself and use that? The answer is, to prevent making
    // it recoverable. You don't even want someone to get that session key and then
    // recover your PLAINTEXT password! Maybe he'll go use it on a thousand websites!
    // 
    // Next: How to protect the session key (an OTSymmetricKey) from being found?
    // First: destroy it often. Make a new session key EVERY time the timeout happens.
    // Also: use it in protected memory as before. This could ALWAYS have a timeout
    // of 0! If it's in ssh-agent, what more can you do? At least OT will make this
    // configurable, and will be pretty damned secure in its own right. Ultimately
    // the best solution here is an extern hardware such as a smart card.
