	mapOfBylaws			m_mapBylaws;	// The Bylaws for this contract.
	// -------------------------------------------------------------------

	// While calculating the ID of smart contracts (and presumably other scriptables)
	// we remove specifics such as asset types, asset accounts, Nym IDs, stashes, etc.
	// We override OTContract::CalculateContractID(), where we set m_bCalculatingID to
	// true (it's normally false). Then we call UpdateContents(), which knows to produce
	// an empty version of the contract if m_bCalculatingID is true. Then we hash that
	// in order to get the contract ID, and then we set m_bCalculatingID back to false
	// again.
	//
	// HOWEVER, there may be more options than with baskets (which also use the above
	// trick. Should the smart contract specify a specific asset type, or should it leave
	// the asset type blank?  Should it specify certain parties, or should it leave the
	// parties blank? I think the accounts should always be blank for calculating ID.
	// And the agents should. And stashes which should be blank in new contracts (always.)
	// But for asset types and parties, shouldn't people be able to specify, for a smart
	// contract template, whether the asset types are part of the contract or whether they
	// are left blank?
	// Furthermore, doesn't this mean that variables need to ALWAYS store their INITIAL
	// value, since they can change over time? We DO want to figure the variable's initial
	// value into the contract ID, but we do NOT want to figure the variable's CURRENT value
	// into that ID (because then comparing the IDs will fail once the variables change.)
	//
	// Therefore, there needs to be a variable on the scriptable itself which determines
	// the template type of the scriptable: m_bSpecifyAssetID and m_bSpecifyParties, which
	// must each be saved individually on OTScriptable.
	//
	// Agents should be entirely removed during contract ID calculating process, since 
	// the Parties can already be specified, and since they can choose their agents at the
	// time of signing -- which are otherwise irrelevant since only the parties are liable.
	//
	// Accounts, conversely, CAN exist on the contract while calculating its ID, but the
	// actual account IDs will be left blank and the asset type IDs will be left blank
	// if m_bSpecifyAssetID is false. (Just as Parties' Owner IDs will be left blank
	// if m_bSpecifyParties is false.)
	//
	// Transaction numbers on parties AND accounts should be set to 0 during calculation
	// of contract ID. Agent name should be left blank on both of those as well.
	//
	// On OTParty, signed copy can be excluded. All agents can be excluded. Authorizing agent
	// can be excluded and Owner ID is conditional on m_bSpecifyParties. (Party name is kept.)
