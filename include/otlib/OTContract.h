	// by the issuer.
	//
	// Why is this important?
	//
	// Because when the issuer connects to the e-notary to issue the currency, he must upload the
	// asset contract as part of that process. During the same process, the e-notary connects to that
	// standard URL and downloads a RECORD, signed by the ISSUER, showing the e-notary on the accepted
	// list of transaction providers.
	//
	// Now the e-notary can make THAT record available to its clients (most likely demanded by their 
	// wallet software) as proof that the issuer has, in fact, issued digital assets on the e-notary
	// server in question. This provides proof that the issuer is, in fact, legally on the line for
	// whatever assets they have actually issued through that e-notary. The issuer can make the total
	// outstanding units available publicly, which wallets can cross-reference with the public records
	// on the transaction servers. (The figures concerning total issued currency should match.)
	//
	// Of course, the transaction server could still lie, and publish a falsified number instead of
	// the actual total issued currency for a given digital asset. Only systems can prevent that, 
	// based around separation of powers. People will be more likely to trust the transaction provider
	// who has good accounting and code audit processes, with code fingerprints, multiple passwords
	// across neutral and bonded 3rd parties, insured, etc.  Ultimately these practices will be
