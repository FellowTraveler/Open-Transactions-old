/// OTMasterKey
/// This class handles the functionality of caching the master key for X seconds

/// in an OTSymmetricKey, which can be unlocked to an OTPassword again for X more
/// seconds (by entering the passphrase...)
/**
 
 How does OTMasterKey work, in a nutshell?
 
 -- It's a singleton. There's only one "master key" for the application and it's
    available globally like this: OTMasterKey::It(). For example: OTMasterKey::It()->IsGenerated()
 
 -- m_pSymmetricKey contains a symmetric key in ENCRYPTED form, which loads
    up from the wallet, and which is always kept in RAM (as on the hard drive)
    ONLY in encrypted form.
 
 -- m_pMasterPassword is the DECRYPTED version of m_pSymmetricKey. When a user enters
    his password, a key derivation hash is used to transform it, and the result is used
    to get an unlocked copy of m_pSymmetricKey, putting the cleartext version into m_pMasterPassword.
 
 -- Why store a decrypted version in memory? So we can set a timer using another thread,
    and thereby return X seconds later, and destroy that decrypted version. In the meantime,
    until it is destroyed, it will be used automatically by OT, every time a password is needed
    until those X seconds are over.
 
 -- That's still not good enough: the decrypted version should still be stored in protected
    memory, using some standard API such as gpg-agent or Windows VirtualProtect. And whatever
    is stored there, should ALSO be encrypted to a session key which is re-generated for every
    run of the application. Furthermore, the decrypted version being stored isn't the user's 
    actual passphrase, nor is it the key derived from it via some password hash algorithm, but
    instead is a random number that was generated in order to be used as the master key.
 
 -- This means that the actual password the user enters, is never stored anywhere. Neither is
    the key derived from that password, since both can instantly be erased after using them to
    unlock the master key. Furthermore the master key is encrypted to a temporary session key,
    which is different for every run of the application, so it is never stored cleartext in
    memory, either, nor is it thus available to anyone with backdoors into protected memory.
    
 -- Not only does the session key change after each run of the application, but it is possible
    to replace the master key without forcing a change of the password itself. Likewise it is
    also possible to change the password, without changing the underlying key that it opens.
    Adding the session key will further ensure that neither password nor master key ever appears
    in RAM (for very long) nor on the harddrive in cleartext form.
 
 -- Adding the use of a standard protected memory API such as gpg-agent means there is no risk
    of swapping or core dumps revealing vital information from within OT itself. Nevertheless,
    the OTPassword class takes pains to prevent core dumps and swapping, and also uses tricks
    to zero sensitive memory after it has been used.
 
 -- The protected memory API has no access to what it is storing, due to the session key. I will
    make this configurable so that users can choose their own authentication mechanisms.
 
 -- Since a thread is used to implement a timer for wiping the master key after X seconds, a mutex
    appears in the class below, which must be locked by any functions in order to use the master key.
    (They do this behind the scenes automatically.)
 
 -- An OT operation will behave in this way:  The user tries to withdraw cash, and thus must sign
    a withdrawal request. An OpenSSL call is used to sign the request, and the OT password callback
    is passed to the OpenSSL call, which OpenSSL will call in the event that it needs a password.
    When that happens, OT will, instead of popping up the password dialog to the user, will notice
    that the master key password has been decrypted already and is within the X seconds window, so it
    will use that password to unlock the master key, which it passes to OpenSSL instead of asking
    the user to enter his passphrase. If the timer had already been expired by that time, then the
    master key password would have been destroyed already, meaning OT has no way to open the master key,
    so OT would then pop up the passphrase dialog and ask the user to enter his passphrase, use that
    to derive a key, and use that to unlock the master key password, and then use that to unlock the
    master key and pass that back to OpenSSL via the callback function.
 
 
 
 -- OT might do several operations within a SINGLE USE CASE. For example, for a cash withdrawal, OT
    might sign the transaction item, sign the balance agreement item, sign the main transaction 
    containing those items, AND sign the message containing that transaction. Perhaps OT has to
    use that private key 4 or 5 times in a row, all within a fraction of a second. Should the user
    therefore have to enter his passphrase 4 or 5 times, for a cash withdrawal? Isn't once enough?
    But it's not that simple, because each operation opens the master key just long enough for OpenSSL
    to perform the requested operation, and then destroys it again immediately after the operation is
    completed. (Even when the timeout is active, what's being stored isn't the master key itself, but
    the master key password used to open it JUST LONG ENOUGH to use it, and then destroy it again.)
    The critical point to understand is that, especially with the introduction of the session key, EVEN
    though a timeout is happening, the master key itself is STILL destroyed after each operation, even
    4 or 5 times in a row really fast, for some single use case transaction to occur.
 
 -- If you set your timeout to -1, then the master key passphrase will never expire. But if your timeout
    is set to 0, then you will have to type your password 4 or 5 times for a single transaction. Get it?
    If you set it to 300 (seconds) then you will only have to type your passphrase once and then your
    application will work for 5 minutes without having to type it again, not even once more, until that
    5 minutes are up, and then you will definitely have to type that password again before doing another
    operation.
 
 -- This is an area where much can be gained through the study of code obfuscation, randomizing memory
    locations, zeroing memory after use, using protected memory APIs, using session keys, using outsourced
    authentication systems such as ssh-agent instead of handling it internally, stack smashing techniques
    such as canaries, etc etc. This is always a moving target.

    4.2 Iteration count 

    An iteration count has traditionally served the purpose of increasing 
    the cost of producing keys from a password, thereby also increasing 
    the difficulty of attack. For the methods in this document, a minimum 
    of 1000 iterations is recommended. This will increase the cost of 
    exhaustive search for passwords significantly, without a noticeable 
    impact in the cost of deriving individual keys. 

Time the KDF on your systems and see how many iterations are practical 
without signficant resource impact on legitimate use cases. If it is 
practical to make the count configurable, do so, otherwise hard-code 
a sensible value that is at least 1000. 

The iteration count is a multiplier on the CPU cost of brute-force 
dictionary attacks. If you are not sure that users are choosing "strong" 
passwords (they rarely do), you want to make dictionary attacks difficult 
by making individual password->key calculations sufficiently slow thereby 
limiting the throughput of brute-force attacks. 

If no legitimate system is computing multiple password-based keys per 
second, you could set the iteration count to consume 10-100ms of CPU 
on 2008 processors, this is likely much more than 1000 iterations. 
At a guess 1000 iterations will be O(1ms) per key on a typical modern CPU. 
This is based on "openssl speed sha1" reporting: 

type             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytes 
sha1             18701.67k    49726.06k   104600.90k   141349.84k   157502.27k 

or about 10^6 16-byte SHA1 ops per second, doing 1000 iterations of HMAC 
is approximately 2000 SHA1 ops and so should take about 2ms. In many 
applications 10,000 or even 100,000 may be practical provided no 
legitimate "actor" needs to perform password->key comptutations at 
a moderately high rate.
