/*
 
 
 Daughter of Babylon
 
 
Go down, sit in the dust, 
 virgin daughter of Babylon;
 sit on the ground without a throne.
 
Oh beautiful Babylon, 
 sit now in darkness, 
 and silence.

Never again will you be known as the 'Lady of kingdoms.'
No more will you be called tender or delicate.

You said, "I am forever—the eternal queen!"
 But you did not consider these things,
 or reflect on what might happen.
 
Now then, listen, you lover of pleasure, 
 lounging in your security, 
  and saying to yourself,
"I am, and there is none besides me."
 
They come from faraway lands,
 from the ends of the heavens—
  the LORD and the weapons of his wrath—
   to destroy the whole country.
 
Like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd,
 they will all return to their own people, 
 they will flee to their native land.

This is the plan determined for the whole world;
this is the hand stretched out over all nations.
 
Behold, the least of the nations shall be a wilderness, 
  a dry land and a desert.

Everyone shall turn to his own people,
  and everyone shall flee to his own land.
 
Your mother shall be deeply ashamed;
  she who bore you shall be ashamed.
 
How the hammer of the whole earth has been cut apart and broken!
 How Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!
  For she has been proud against the LORD.
 
We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed.
 Forsake her, and let us go everyone to his own country;
  For her judgment reaches to heaven and is lifted up to the skies.
 
Oh you who dwell by many waters, abundant in treasures, 
 your end has come.

Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, 
 who destroys all the earth,” says the LORD.
 
And I will stretch out My hand against you,
  roll you down from the rocks, 
   and make you a burnt mountain.
 
Oh, how the praise of the whole earth is seized!
 How Babylon has become desolate among the nations!
 
And though Babylon should mount up to heaven,
 and fortify her skies, 
  destroyers will come to her from me,
   declares the LORD.
 
The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, 
 and her high gates shall be burned with fire.
 Because of the fire, the people and nations will labor in vain, 
   and they shall be weary.
 
Keep on, then, with your magic spells
 and with your many sorceries, 
  which you have labored at since childhood.
 
Let your astrologers come forward,
 those stargazers who make predictions month by month,
  let them save you from what is coming upon you.
 
Surely they are like stubble; 
 the fire will burn them up.
  They cannot even save themselves
   from the power of the flame.
 
These are not coals for warmth,
 this is not a fire to sit by.
All of them go on in their error;
 there is not one that can save you.
 
 ------------------------------------------------
 
Then the angel carried me away into a wilderness. 
  There I saw a woman sitting on a beast,
   with seven heads and ten horns.
 
The angel said, 
 "The beast will hate the whore. 
  They will bring her to ruin, and leave her naked.
  They will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.

 "The woman you saw is the great city 
  that reigns over the kings of the earth."
 
Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!
 She has become a home for demons,
  and a haunt for every evil spirit, 
  a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird.
 
For all the nations have drunk 
  the maddening wine of her adulteries. 
The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, 
  and the merchants of the earth grew rich 
   from her excessive luxuries.
 
In her heart she is proud, and she boasts, 
 "I sit as queen; I shall see no sorrow."
 
Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: 
 famine, mourning, and death. 
  She will be consumed by fire, 
   for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.
 
When the kings of the earth 
 who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury, 
  see the smoke of her burning, 
   they will weep and mourn over her. 
 
Terrified at her torment, 
  they will stand far off and cry:
 
"Woe! Woe, O great city, 
 O Babylon, city of power! 
 In one hour your doom has come!"
 
The merchants of the earth 
  will weep and mourn over her,
   because no one buys their cargoes any more.
 
Cargoes of gold, silver, 
  precious stones and pearls,
  fine linen, and silk,
  and purple and scarlet cloth,
  every sort of citron wood,
 
And articles of every kind,
  made of costly wood, ivory,
  bronze, iron and marble.
 
Cargoes of cinnamon and spice, 
  of incense, myrrh and frankincense, 
  of wine and olive oil, 
  of fine flour and wheat,
  cattle and sheep,
  horses and carriages,
and bodies and souls of men.
 
The fruit that your soul longed for is gone from you.
  All your sumptuous things and shining splendor
   have perished from you,
  and you shall find them no more.

The merchants of these things, 
 which were made rich by her, 
  shall stand afar off,
   out of fear of her torment.
 
Weeping and wailing, they will say, 
 "Woe! Woe, O great city, 
   clothed in fine linen, and decked in gold,
    precious stones and pearls!
"In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!"
 
Every sea captain, 
 and all who travel by ship, 
  the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, 
   will stand far off because of the fear of her torment.
When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim:
 "Was there ever a city like this great city?"
 
They will throw dust on their heads, 
  and with weeping and mourning, cry out:
“Woe! Woe, O great city, 
 where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! 
In one hour she has been brought to ruin!”
 
Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder, 
 the size of a large millstone, 
  and threw it into the sea, and said:
 
  "With such violence,
    the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, 
     never to be found again.
 
   "The voice of harpists and musicians, 
     flute players and trumpeters, 
     will never be heard in you again.
 
   "No artisan of any craft 
     will ever be found in you again.
 
   "The sound of a millstone 
     will never be heard in you again.
 
   "The light of a lamp 
     will never shine in you again.
 
   "The voice of bridegroom and bride 
     will never be heard in you again.
 
   "For your merchants were the world’s great men,
     and by your magic spell, 
      all the nations were led astray."
