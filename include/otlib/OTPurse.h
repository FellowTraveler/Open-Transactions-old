// after it is spent.)

// I will add an optional UserID field, so it's obvious whose public key to use for opening the tokens.
// This may seem odd, but the field is entirely optional because it's not necessary for the actual operation.
// The recipient will already know to use his own private key to open the purse, and then he will immediately
// open it, redeem the coins, and store the replacements again encrypted to his own key, until he spends them
// again to someone else, when he will also know to encrypt the purse to THEIR public key, and so on.

// The interface of this class is that of a simple stack.
