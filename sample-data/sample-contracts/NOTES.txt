localhost.otc is actually a signed contract, so it will work.
localhost.xml is the unsigned version of it. You can sign it using
signcontract.exe

silver.otc and tokens.otc are also signed. But unlike the server contract, 
they are signed by the FT test nym, not the server nym. That's because it
is USERS who issue currencies, not necessarily the server operator. So if 
you wipe all the certs, keypairs, etc and recreate them, be warned that you 
will not be able to use these currency contracts for ISSUING anymore. (Until
you put the new public key into the contract and re-sign it with the new
private key yadda yadda yadda.) 

You will still be able to use them for creating asset accounts of the same
type, but you will NOT be able to use them for issuing new asset types.

This is because the contract key INSIDE the contract is the same one that
was used to sign the contract.  ONLY that user can issue the curency, though
ANY other user can open an asset account to TRADE in that currency.

To sign a contract with the wallet:

1) Load the wallet up and connect to the server.

2) type "signcontract" and the wallet will ask you to enter an unsigned contract.

3) The new signed contract will be displayed on the screen.

4) From there, you can copy that, and issue a currency by typing "issue". It will 
   ask you to enter the (signed) currency contract, then send a message to the server
   in order to create the new asset type.


There is also a signcontract command line utility.
