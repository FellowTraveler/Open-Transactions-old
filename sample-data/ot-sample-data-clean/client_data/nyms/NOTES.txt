There must be a nymfile in here for each User Account.  
(User ID is consistent across multiple servers.)

The filename can be whatever you want, as long as the 
same filename is the one listed in the wallet file.

The nymfile stores the current request number for any 
given server, as well as any transaction numbers that 
user has downloaded (from any server.)

IMPORTANT: the Nymfile contains a NymID field. That field
MUST contain the same NymID that the wallet is expecting
to find after it loads the wallet file.
Otherwise you will see an error client that the NymID
didn't match the one in the wallet. That's okay, just
make sure to edit both files to have the same NymID.

(It will be expecting a specific ID based on a hash of your
public key for that user.)

There needs to be a nice PRETTY client GUI that handles
this stuff transparently.
