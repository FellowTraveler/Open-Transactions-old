Client custom scripts can go in this directory, and sub-dirs, and OT should
just find them.

Also see opentxs, scripts can be integrated with this tool.

'opentxs' is the beginnings of a high-level command-line interface for OT.
(The other command-line interface, 'ot' is too low-level for users to use directly.)

Try this: opentxs list
