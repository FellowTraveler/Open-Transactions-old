The result:

   OT> 

----------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS:

stat         -- Display wallet contents.

(Yes, that's just a 'c' by itself down there.)

c            -- Sends a checkServerID command. This is OTLib's "Ping". 
                It's the wallet pinging the notary, and verifying to
                both sides that each can encrypt/verify with the other.
 
r            -- Register a new user account (using first Nym in wallet.)
                (Register will fail for you because I already registered
                with this Nym. So you can just START USING IT, since it's
                already registered. Ignore this command, in other words.)
 
u            -- Sends a checkUser command (retrieves public key based on
                userID)

g            -- Ask the server to send me the current request number.
                If you get errors that the request number is wrong, use
                this and then try again. (It must always be in sync. This
                command is what re-syncs it.)

issue        -- Issue new currency. (It will ask for the currency contract.)
                The wallet will ask you for the currency contract and then
                create an issuer account. The public key in the currency 
                contract must be the same as the Nym's public key, AND the
                signature on the contract must verify with that same key.

(I already uploaded the silver contract, which is why you see it in your wallet as though you are the issuer of that currency -- because you are.)

getcontract  -- Get server's copy of any currency contract, by asset
                type ID.

getmint      -- Get server's copy of public Mint file (contains public
                keys for each asset type. This is needed in order to make
                withdrawal requests for any given asset type.)

a            -- create asset account. (Of any type, including any
                Basket Type ID, which is used like another asset type ID.)

get          -- Get latest copy of one of my asset accounts (by account ID).

n            -- Ask the server to send me a new transaction number.
                (If you ever get an error related to being out of transaction
                numbers, just use this. Sometimes you just run out of them,
                and you need more from the server.) As a utility tool, if you 
                append a long integer as the first parameter, then OT will add
                that number to the Nym as if it were a signed-for transaction number.

y            -- After you ask for a few more transaction numbers, you will need to
                download your Nymbox so you can get them and sign for them.

py           -- Usually whenever downloading your Nymbox, you want to just do this one
                next. (It will process all the nymbox items, which is necessary in
                order to accept and sign-for new transaction numbers.)

t            -- Initiate transfer from my account into another account's
                inbox (with a pending notice being put into my outbox). 

i            -- getInbox from the server so I can decide what to do with
                it. (There will be pending notices, cheque receipts, etc.
                I need to go through them all and accept or reject them.)

pi           -- After getInbox, use this to just accept everything in your inbox.

NOTE: Obviously a real GUI client would merely display the inbox to the user, where the user could choose whether or not to accept the items individually. The API offers faculties for doing this.

o           -- getOutbox from the server so my balance statements don't fail.
               (All transactions now require a signed balance receipt, which includes
               data on the inbox items, the outbox items, the current account balance,
               and the current list of transaction numbers that are signed out to me.
               Your outbox should never change on the server side, but if you ever need
               to re-download a copy of it, you will be able to verify it against the
               last signed receipt.)

w            -- Withdraw cash and save to a purse. (It will ask for Account ID and amount.)

Note on token format: the individual notes are stored with the internal Lucre data *encrypted* to the user's Nym.  So even if the tokens were stolen in plaintext, they still could not be used--because the internal Lucre data member is still encrypted. As long as you keep backups of your financial data, they cannot be lost, nor can they be stolen simply by the files becoming compromised.  

v            -- Withdraw voucher. (This is like a cashier's cheque. The
                server removes funds from your account, then issues you a
                cheque drawn on one of the server's accounts.)

q            -- Deposit cheque. (You can also deposit vouchers here.)

d            -- Deposit cash.  (Will ask for Account ID and Cash Note.)

NOTE: When making a deposit, the test client automatically re-encrypts the Lucre data (internal to the token) to the SERVER's nym, so that the server will be able to process the tokens.  Similarly, if you wanted to give some tokens to a friend, using a nice GUI, you would simply drag the gold over to his name, and then your wallet would re-encrypt the internal Lucre Data of each token to his public key, and then send the tokens to him. Future options include exporting to a passphrase, or in the clear.

p            -- Deposit a purse full of cash. (It will ask for the Account
                ID and and Purse.)

cheque       -- Write a cheque. You can do this offline but you need to have
                at least one transaction number laying around to write it with.

basket       -- Create a basket currency. (It will ask for the basket
                details, and lead you through the process.)

NOTE: The wallet will ask for the number of asset types in the basket, then the *minimum transfer amount* for the basket itself, then it will ask for each asset type ID followed by the minimum transfer amount for that asset type. For example: I might create a new basket currency called the Rand, defined as, 10 Rand = [$50, 2 gold g, and 10 silver oz]. Those numbers would serve as the *minimum transfer amount* for each asset type, with all transfers being a multiple of those numbers. 

Normally when you issue a currency, you are given an issuer account by the server. This account is allowed to go negative, and you can transfer to whoever you wish based on the terms of your currency contract. And with a basket currency, an issuer account is also created. But.. instead of handing control of that issuer account over to the user who defined the basket, the server manages it internally. Each basket account has its own internal asset accounts to store the reserves for the basket. Whenever users exchange in or out of a basket, the various assets are moved in or out of those internal asset accounts. After this point, an asset account storing a basket currency is no different than any other asset account, as far as the server is concerned.  It's just another asset type ID.  Due to this, baskets also support infinite nesting yet with no additional system resource usage.


exchange     -- Exchange from asset accounts, in and out of basket
                accounts. This is where the magic happens.

Any exchange in or out is based on a multiple of the minimum transfer amount.  So I could transfer into 10 Rand, or 20, or 30, or 40, etc. Any multiple of 10, since 10 is the minimum amount.  I would have to trade ($50, 2 gold, and 10 silver) times 1, or 2, or 3, etc for the exchange.  Once the user has Rands in his Rand asset account, he can trade it with other Rand asset accounts in any amount he wishes, with no minimum amount. The minimum amount is only for exchanging in and out of the basket.


propose      -- Create a payment plan (like WRITING a proposal.) Merchant does this.
confirm      -- Agree to a payment plan (like SIGNING that agreement). Customer does this.
activate     -- Activate a payment plan (like ACTIVATING the agreement). Customer again.


offer        -- Put an Offer onto a Market.


setnymname      -- Set a Nym's name (merely a client-side label.)
setaccountname  -- Set an Asset Account's name (merely a client-side label.)


signcontract -- Allows you to input a contract and sign it with the
                current Nym.

decode       -- Decodes base64-encoded data at the command line.
encode       -- Base64-encodes data at the command line.

decrypt      -- If you have already loaded your Nym, you can use this
                to decrypt messages at the command line.

clear        -- Clears all of the transaction numbers from a Nym. Low-level tool!
clearreq     -- Clears all the request numbers from a Nym. Low-level tool!

Deprecated: (happens automatically now)
load         -- Load wallet.xml from the data_folder. (Do this first.)


NOTE: The below commands are for TCP / SSL mode only. 
(You can **IGNORE** them.)

connect      -- Connect to the first server on the wallet's list.
                (NOTE: **NOT** necessary in ZMQ mode! If you didn't
                use "make tcp", then you can ignore this command. It's
                only used in TCP/SSL mode.)

1            -- Sends a type 1 header command to the server, with no
                payload.
2            -- Sends a deliberately-malformed command to the server.
3            -- Sends a signed XML message in the payload, but with no
                XML requests.
