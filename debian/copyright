 ADDITIONAL PERMISSION under the GNU Affero GPL version 3
 section 7: (This paragraph applies only to the LAGPLv3
 components listed above.) If you modify this Program, or
 any covered work, by linking or combining it with other
 code, such other code is not for that reason alone subject
 to any of the requirements of the GNU Affero GPL version 3.
 (==> This means if you are only using the OT-API, then you
 don't have to open-source your code--only your changes to
 Open Transactions itself must be open source. Similar to
 LGPLv3, except it applies to software-as-a-service, not
 just to distributing binaries.)
 .
 Extra WAIVER for OpenSSL, Lucre, and all other libraries
 used by Open Transactions: This program is released under
 the AGPL with the additional exemption that compiling,
 linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed. The same is true
 for any other open source libraries included in this
 project: complete waiver from the AGPL is hereby granted to
 compile, link, and/or use them with Open Transactions,
 according to their own terms, as long as the rest of the
 Open Transactions terms remain respected, with regard to
 the Open Transactions code itself.
 .
 Lucre License:
 This code is also "dual-license", meaning that Ben Lau-
 rie's license must also be included and respected, since
 the code for Lucre is also included with Open Transactions.
 See Open-Transactions/OTLib/Lucre/LUCRE_LICENSE.txt
 The Laurie requirements are light, but if there is any
 problem with his license, simply remove the Lucre code.
 Although there are no other blind token algorithms in Open
 Transactions (yet. credlib is coming), the other functions
 will continue to operate.
