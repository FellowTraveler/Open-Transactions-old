# This object handles all the request/response going on with

# complete set of high-level API functions.

# objEasy.check_user corresponds to the command-line:
#   'opentxs checknym'
#
# It's a useful test because it shows whether a server message
# is successful, before going the extra step of trying a real
# financial transaction.
#
# Therefore we only need to verify the Message Success, and not
# any transaction success. (Remember, a successful message can
# still contain a failed transaction.)

# InterpretTransactionMsgReply
#
# This function first verifies whether the message itself was a success.
# (For example, what if the server was down, and never received it?)
#
# Once it verifies that the reply was successful as a message, then it
# peers deeper, to see whether the balance agreement was successful as well.
# (After all, any transaction is automatically rejected if the balance
# agreement is poorly-formed.)
#
# Then if the balance agreement was successful, then finally, this same
# function (InterpretTransactionMsgReply) checks to see whether the
# transaction ITSELF was successful. After all, maybe there was an error
# saving it back to disk on the server side and this caused the transaction
# to fail. Or maybe there wasn't enough money in the account. Etc. All of
# the above work is done in the below call:

# ---------------------------------------------------------

# At this point we're done. We've downloaded a public key from
# the OT server, and we've also withdrawn a little cash from the
# server. We've demonstrated that both the high-level and low-level
# OT APIs are operational through Python.

# So... we're done. Let's shutdown OT and finish execution.
# (Using the low-level API...)
