A few relevant notes, followed by contributor credits:


"The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the LORD of hosts."
Haggai 2:8 

"By your wisdom and your understanding you have made wealth for 
  yourself, and have gathered gold and silver into your treasuries"
Ezekiel 28:4

"Precious treasure and oil are in a wise man's dwelling,
  but a foolish man devours it."
Proverbs 21:20

"Because you say, 'I am rich, and increased with goods, and I need nothing,' 
  and you know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, 
   and naked...
"I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich, 
  and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your 
   nakedness may not be seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, 
    so that you may see."
Rev. 3:17-18

"Say to the children of Israel, I am the LORD, 
  and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, 
  and I will rid you out of their bondage, 
  and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, 
   and with great judgments.
 And I will take you to me for a people, 
  and I will be to you a God: 
  and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, 
   which brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
 And I will bring you in unto the land, 
  concerning which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; 
   and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD."
Exodus 6:6-9

"After the doings of the land of Egypt, 
   (where you lived before), you shall not do: 
  and after the doings of the land of Canaan, 
   (where I am bringing you), you shall not do: 
   neither shall you walk in their ordinances. 
 You shall do MY judgments, and keep MY ordinances, 
   to walk in them: I am the LORD your God. 
 You shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: 
   which if a man does, he shall live in them: I am the LORD."
Leviticus 18:1-5

"Except the LORD build the house, they labor in vain that build it: 
 except the LORD keep the city, the watchman wakes in vain."
Psalms 127

"Do what is right and good in the Lord's sight, 
 so all will go well with you."
Deuteronomy 6:18

"Hate evil, and love good, 
 and establish justice in the courts."
Amos 5:15

"Justice, and only justice, you shall follow,
 that you may live and inherit the land that
 the Lord your God is giving you."
Deuteronomy 16:20

"Select capable men, 
  from all the people,
   men who fear God, 
  trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain,
   and appoint them as officials over thousands, 
    hundreds, fifties and tens."
Exodus 18:21

"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. 
 For there is no power but of God: 
  the powers that be are ordained of God. 
 Whosoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God: 
  and they that resist shall receive to themselves condemnation. 
 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. 
 Will you then not be afraid of the power? 
 Do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same: 
 For he is the minister of God to you for good. 
 But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; 
  for he bears not the sword in vain: 
  for he is the minister of God, 
  a revenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil. 
 Therefore you must be subject, not only for wrath, 
  but also for conscience sake."
Romans 13:1-5

"Woe to those...
  who justify the wicked for a bribe, 
 and take away the rights of the innocent."
Isaiah 5:23

"Woe unto those who decree unrighteous decrees, and 
 write grievousness which they have prescribed;"
Isaiah 10:1

"And David said to God, 
'Wasn't it I who commanded the people to be numbered? 
 I am the one who has sinned, and done evil indeed'"
1 Chronicles 21:17a

"Woe to those who scheme iniquity,
  who work out evil on their beds!
 When morning comes, they do it,
  (for it is in the power of their hands.) 
 They covet fields and then seize them,
  and houses, and take them away.
 They rob a man and his house,
  a man and his inheritance."
Micah 2:1-2

"The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them,
and those who exercise authority over them call
themselves 'Benefactor of the People.'"

among you must be your servant."

"Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto Him, 
    'Master, what shall we do?' 
  And He said to them, 
    'Exact no more than that which is appointed you.' 
  And the soldiers likewise demanded of Him, saying, 
    'And what shall we do?'
  And He said to them, 
    'Do violence to no man, 
      neither accuse any falsely;
       and be content with your wages.'"

   that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you set your hand to 
   in the land you go to possess."
Deuteronomy 23:19-20

  You shall not have different measures in your house, a great and a small.

"It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, 
 and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery." 
-Galatians 5:1

"Whoever hears these words of mine and fails to do them,
  he is like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand,
   and the rain descended, 
    and the rivers came, 
     and the winds blew, 
      and they dashed against that house; 
      and it fell -- and its fall was great."
Matthew 7:26-27

"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: 
   because you have rejected knowledge, 
  I will also reject you, 
   that you shall be no priest to me: 
    seeing you have forgotten the law of your God, 
  I will also forget your children."
Hosea 4:6

"Come now you rich,
  weep and howl for your miseries 
  which are coming upon you.
 Your riches have rotted
  Your gold and your silver have rusted
  and their rust will be a witness against you.
 It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure!
 Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields
   (which has been withheld by you)
    cries out against you,
  and the outcry of those who did the harvesting
   has reached the ears of the Lord of the Sabbath.
 You have lived luxuriously on the earth,
  and led a life of wanton pleasure.
 You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
 You have condemned and murdered the righteous man;"
James 5:1-6

"'...And you had turned, and had done right in my sight, in 
   proclaiming liberty, every man to his neighbor; and you had made a 
    covenant before me in the house which is called by my name.
"'But you turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his
   servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had set at liberty, to 
    return, and brought them into subjection, to be your servants and 
     handmaids.
"'Therefore,' (thus says the Lord) 'You have not hearkened unto me, 
   in proclaiming a liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his
    neighbor: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, says the Lord, to the 
     sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be 
      removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.'"
Jeremiah 34:15-17

"Now it shall come to pass in the latter days 
  that the mountain of the LORD's house 
 shall be established on the top of the mountains, 
  and shall be exalted above the hills; 
   and all nations shall flow to it. 
 Many people shall come and say:
  'Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, 
    to the house of the God of Jacob; 
   He will teach us His ways, 
    and we shall walk in His paths.'
 For out of Zion shall go forth the law, 
  and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."
Isaiah 2:2-3

"In the last days... everyone will 
  sit under their own vine,
   and under their own fig tree, 
    and no one will make them afraid, 
   for the LORD Almighty has spoken."
Micah 4:1-4

"Because the creature itself also shall be delivered 
  from the bondage of corruption
 into the glorious liberty of the children of God."
Romans 8:21






Thomas Paine wrote in COMMON SENSE:


Government by kings was first introduced into the world by the
Heathens, from whom the children of Israel copied the custom. It was
the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the
promotion of idolatry. The Heathens paid divine honors to their
deceased kings, and the Christian world hath improved on the plan by
doing the same to their living ones.

How impious is the title of sacred majesty applied to a worm, who in
the midst of his splendor is crumbling into dust!

As the exalting one man so greatly above the rest cannot be
justified on the equal rights of nature, so neither can it be
defended on the authority of scripture; for the will of the
Almighty, as declared by Gideon and the prophet Samuel, expressly
disapproves of government by kings.

All anti-monarchial parts of scripture have been very smoothly
glossed over in monarchial governments, but they undoubtedly merit
the attention of countries which have their governments yet to form.
Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's is the scriptural
doctrine of courts, yet it is no support of monarchial government,
for the Jews at that time were without a king, and in a state of
vassalage to the Romans.

Near three thousand years passed away from the Mosaic account of the
creation, till the Jews under a national delusion requested a king.
Till then their form of government (except in extraordinary cases,
where the Almighty interposed) was a kind of republic administered
by a judge and the elders of the tribes. Kings they had none, and it
was held sinful to acknowledge any being under that title but the
Lords of Hosts.

And when a man seriously reflects on the idolatrous homage which is
paid to the persons of kings he need not wonder, that the Almighty,
ever jealous of his honor, should disapprove of a form of government
which so impiously invades the prerogative of heaven.
...
The children of Israel being oppressed by the Midianites, Gideon
marched against them with a small army, and victory, through the
divine interposition, decided in his favor. The Jews, elate with
success, and attributing it to the generalship of Gideon, proposed
making him a king, saying, "Rule thou over us, thou and thy son and
thy son's son."

Here was temptation in its fullest extent; not a kingdom only, but
an hereditary one, but Gideon in the piety of his soul replied, "I
will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you, THE LORD
SHALL RULE OVER YOU."

Words need not be more explicit; Gideon doth not decline the honor
but denies their right to give it; neither doth he compliment them
with invented declarations of his thanks, but in the positive style
of a prophet charges them with disaffection to their proper
sovereign, the King of Heaven.

About one hundred and thirty years after this, they fell again into
the same error. The hankering which the Jews had for the idolatrous
customs of the Heathens, is something exceedingly unaccountable; but
so it was, that laying hold of the misconduct of Samuel's two sons,
who were entrusted with some secular concerns, they came in an
abrupt and clamorous manner to Samuel, saying, "Behold thou art old
and thy sons walk not in thy ways, now make us a king to judge us
like all the other nations."

And here we cannot but observe that their motives were bad, viz.,
that they might be like unto other nations, i.e., the Heathen,
whereas their true glory laid in being as much unlike them as
possible. But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, give us a
king to judge us; and Samuel prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord said
unto Samuel, "Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say
to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me,
THEN I SHOULD NOT REIGN OVER THEM. According to all the works which 
they have done since the day; wherewith they brought them up out of 
Egypt, even unto this day; wherewith they have forsaken me and served
other Gods; so do they also unto you.

"Now therefore hearken unto their voice, howbeit, protest solemnly
unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over
them," i.e., not of any particular king, but the general manner of
the kings of the earth, whom Israel was so eagerly copying after.
And notwithstanding the great distance of time and difference of
manners, the character is still in fashion.

And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people, that
asked of him a king. And he said, "This shall be the manner of the
king that shall reign over you:

"He will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his
chariots, and to be his horsemen, and some shall run before his
chariots [this description agrees with the present mode of
impressing men] and he will appoint him captains over thousands and
captains over fifties, and will set them to ear his ground and to
reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
instruments of his chariots; and he will take your daughters to be
confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers [this describes the
expense and luxury as well as the oppression of kings] and he will
take your fields and your olive yards, even the best of them, and
give them to his servants; and he will take the tenth of your seed,
and of your vineyards, and give them to his officers and to his
servants [by which we see that bribery, corruption, and favoritism
are the standing vices of kings] and he will take the tenth of your
men servants, and your maid servants, and your goodliest young men
and your asses, and put them to his work; and he will take the tenth
of your sheep, ---and ye shall be his servants--- and ye shall cry
out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen, AND
THE LORD WILL NOT HEAR YOU IN THAT DAY."

This accounts for the continuation of monarchy; neither do the
characters of the few good kings which have lived since, either
sanctify the title, or blot out the sinfulness of the origin; the
high encomium given of David takes no notice of him officially as a
king, but only as a man after God's own heart.

Nevertheless the People refused to obey the voice of Samuel, and
they said, "Nay, but we will have a king over us, that we may be like
all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before
us and fight our battles."

Samuel continued to reason with them, but to no purpose; he set
before them their ingratitude, but all would not avail; and seeing
them fully bent on their folly, he cried out, "I will call unto the
Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain [which then was a
punishment, being the time of wheat harvest] that ye may perceive
and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the
sight of the Lord, IN ASKING YOU A KING."

So Samuel called unto the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain
that day, and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel. And
all the people said unto Samuel, "Pray for thy servants unto the Lord
thy God that we die not, for WE HAVE ADDED UNTO OUR SINS THIS EVIL,
TO ASK A KING."

These portions of scripture are direct and positive. They admit of
no equivocal construction. That the Almighty hath here entered his
protest against monarchial government is true, or the scripture is
false. And a man hath good reason to believe that there is as much
of kingcraft, as priestcraft in withholding the scripture from the
public in Popish countries. For monarchy in every instance is the
Popery of government.

As lots of references in this documentation and the source show, this xml 
parser has originally been a part of the 
<A HREF="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net" >Irrlicht Engine</A>. But because
the parser has become very useful with the latest release, people asked for
a separate version of it, to be able to use it in non Irrlicht projects.
With irrXML 1.0, this has now been done.

HONORABLE MENTIONS


/*
  It seems appropriate to mention a few other people who deserve mentioning.

  A moment of silence for "Jolly Good Fellow" Bernard von NotHaus, 
  the founder of NORFED who was recently (and wrongfully) convicted of
  "domestic terrorism."

  For history, I will reproduce a few gloating FBI quotes:

  "Attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country
   are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism."
   ...
  "We are determined to meet these threats through infiltration,
   disruption, and dismantling of organizations which seek to challenge
   the legitimacy of our democratic form of government."
   ...
  "While these forms of anti-government activities do not involve
   violence, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and
   present danger to the economic stability of this country."

 // -----------------------------------------------

  Speaking of wrongful prosecution...

  Tip of the hat to Dr. Douglas Jackson for his sacrifices and
  accomplishments.
  May this software protect future innovators from persecution, in a
  diversity of jurisdictions.  And check out e-gold.com, as well as
  goldmoney.com, igolder, pecunix, and all the other digital gold
  reserve outfits. May they all soon be traded as a single basket
  currency using this new software.
  
 // -----------------------------------------------

  Aaron Swartz, in the depths of depression, was driven to suicide by
  unfair prosecution -- and what he did was illegal -- but he was _not_
  a criminal. He didn't beat, rob, or murder anyone. He was someone who
  fought for the good of all mankind.
  His girlfriend, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, said of him:
  
  "I've never met anyone so single-minded about changing the world."

  To all hackers who DDoS -- please consider building something instead.
  
  "Strike the root."
  
  (You won't do anyone any good in prison.)

  Thank you to David Chaum, for inventing digital cash in the first place.

  Kudos to David Wagner, and Ben Laurie, who brought us Lucre.

  Kudos to Ian Grigg for his many advancements in financial cryptography.  
  Check out his website at http://iang.org/

  J. Orlin Grabbe and his writings have been inspirational. He will be
  missed. His DMT as well as critiques of it were useful to me.

  Thank you to Richard Stallman: His concept of of the GPL license has
  made an historic and immeasurable contribution to human liberty.
  
  Thank you also to Satoshi Nakamoto, for developing the world's first
  censorship-resistant digital asset and currency (Bitcoin.)

  Kudos to Phil Zimmermann for writing and releasing PGP. The man who put
  power into the hands of the people. Many people in corrupt jurisdictions
  now have PGP to thank for their lives. Let's do the same for their money.

  Bill St. Clair, whose Truledger was truly inspirational. Check out
  Truledger at http://truledger.com/

  Patrick Chkoreff, whose Loom is operational and is what showed me the
  idea of separation of powers. Check out https://Loom.cc for more info.

  Andrew McMeikan's PKTP, which can be found here:   http://pktp.co.cc/
 
  Ryan Fugger's Ripple project, which will probably figure more into the
  client development of OpenTransactions.    http://ripple-project.org/

  Jim Bell, of course. His story is partially the reason for this software.
  I still don't understand why he was stink-bombing IRS offices instead of
  writing code. But he definitely made his mark. 

  Tim May for writing the Cyphernomicon. (Google it.)

  Robert A. Hettinga for his writings:  http://www.philodox.com/

  And of course SAMY, who wrote the famous MySpace worm, and who suggested
  using two message digest algorithms XOR'd together in case one is ever
  broken and needs to be swapped out.  Thus the SAMY hash is named in his
  honor, and utilizes WHIRLPOOL XOR'd with SHA-256.

                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published
    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public
    License along with this program.  If not, see:
    <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU AGPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
