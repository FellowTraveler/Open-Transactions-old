NOTES on the Version:

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   0.21 --- Windows release!

           Open Transactions now supports Windows, LINUX, and Mac OS X.
           (In the same code base.)
           
           This distribution comes with gcc Makefiles for Mac and Linux,
           as well as XCode project files for Mac and Microsoft VC++ project
           files for Windows.
           
           The Windows port was at the request of an Android developer who
           has begun work on a wallet (client app) that he calls "FiatCash".
           He will be building it on Windows, in Java, using the Open
           Transactions JNI interface to talk to the library. When complete,
           the wallet software will run on Android phones.
           
           INVOICES: Imagine that you hand someone an invoice. He runs it
           through his bank account and the money is automatically transferred
           to you, with receipts on both sides. This is the same thing as
           a cheque with a negative amount. Thus, "negative cheques" can be
           used as invoices. (Already operational.)
           
           Assorted:
           
           Many of the C Standard Library includes were replaced with their
           C++ standard library versions.
           
           Other cleanups were made including some fixes to OTString (which
           used to have some large stack-allocations) as well as a bug fix
           in the socket code for the server / test client.

           The client cert expired, so I re-created all the certs. If you have
           any problem with your own, just install the new version to fix it.

   0.2 --- Major Release!  ALL NEW:

           JNI Interface (High-level Java API)

           High-level C++ Interface

           Spent Token Database is fully operational!

           Mints and Tokens now support Expiration AND Series. 

           New Financial Instruments: Cheques and Vouchers.

           Reserve accounts are now working to store the backing funds
           for cash withdrawals and vouchers (cashier's cheques.)

           Transaction numbers are fully working now.
           
           Nym files are now signed (to prevent tampering.)

           Hardcoding of paths was fixed, using config files and
           command-line arguments now, so you can use the software 
           without having to change the code.

           Path separators were improved to support Windows-style paths
           (though I haven't tried to actually build on Windows.)

           Numerous bug fixes. Including a big one: discarding
           token signature after unblinding.

  0.11 --- Added LINUX support... 

           Added Makefiles, and a few fixes related to Linux. 
           
           OT now runs on TWO platforms: LINUX and Mac OS X.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  0.1  --- The original goal was just proof-of-concept. There are many
           TODOs listed on the project page, as well as throughout the
           code.  But it all works!!!
		   
   A WARNING: This software is brand-spanking-new.  The project has not
yet been audited for security or tested for any extended period of time.
Thus far, it must be considered as for experimental purposes only.
		   
       --- There are still a few values that are hardcoded (in the client
           and the server), unfortunately, but it's all documented and I
           have everything set up already to run, so you don't have to
           mess with them. This will be fixed next release.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The server expects its OWN cert to be in the  transaction/certs folder.
The filename should be the server_user_ID from notaryServer.xml
(I HAVE ALREADY PLACED IT THERE.)

This is the file that includes the server's public AND private key.
