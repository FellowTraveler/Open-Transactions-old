NOTES on the Version:

// --------------------------------------------------------------------

   0.76 --- Bugfix release. Many bugs were uncovered by recent testing with
            new users. (One user with an especially bad network connection.)
            OT now has much more powerful polling, blocking, configurability,
            timeouts, synchronization, and robustness against network faults.
            Also see resync.ot in
            the scripts folder.

   0.75 --- Smart Contracts! (Server-side SCRIPTABLE CLAUSES, and hooks!)
            Users can now design and activate their own financial instruments,
            in SCRIPT FORM!
            
            Also, configurable permissions were added for all of the OT server's
            transactions and messages. See your config file: ~/.ot/server.cfg

   0.74 --- OT can now be configured (or not) to require USAGE CREDITS.
            (This makes it possible for server operators to charge transaction fees.)
            API functions were added for viewing and setting these usage credits.

            Also: I added whitespace trimming, to make sure contracts will calculate
            the exact same ID every single time. (I regenerated all the test data.)

   0.73 --- Client side scripting! See the Open-Transactions/scripts folder.
            (The *entire* OT API is now available for use inside the client-
             side scripts.)

   0.72b--- Bug fix in Basket Exchange (which is now working in the GUI!)

   0.72a--- More bug fixes. Plus: added more options to the ini files.

   0.72 --- This release was all debugging. It's downright embarrassing,
            all the bugs I still had to fix. A new version of the GUI is
            coming soon, with matching fixes.

   0.71 --- Massive upgrades to the command-line utility for OT, as well
            as the addition of "make install". Lots of debugging.
            Default data folders are now ~/.ot/server_data and ~/.ot/client_data

   0.70 --- Added finalReceipt, basketReceipt, plus related internal changes.
            Also added messages for DELETING accounts and nyms. 

   0.69 --- Bug fixes in preparation for the new MARKETS screen...

   0.68 --- Minor bug fixes at the request of client developers.

   0.67 --- Output now goes to a logfile (in the config file) or stderr.
            No more logs to standard output. OT client no longer hangs if
            server isn't running. Client and Server now both use ini files
            as well as config files.

   0.66 --- Added the rest of the Market API, since the GUI will soon
            support it!

   0.65 --- THE SAMPLE DATA WAS ALL RE-GENERATED... So grab it, plus the
            latest version of the code. What all changed?
 
            I added default packing to all OTASCIIArmor strings. I think
            OT should now be binary compatible across all platforms, but
            we'll see. Oh and, due to this, re-generated all sample data.

            ===> Also added bindings for **the D programming language**
                 http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/overview.html

            ===> Also added .ot_ini files! (What sorts of options would 
                 YOU like to see in the configuration files for OT?)

            Also did some bug fixes in OTString, OTMint, and createmint.

   0.64 --- Added default packing (currently protobuf) to all binary
            to base64 encoding. I had a recent complaint about binary
            incompatibility across platform, and this is either the
            complete fix, or at least a strong beginning of a drive to
            ensure binary compatibility across all platforms.

   0.63 --- Open Transactions has entirely been converted to the NEW
            STORAGE CLASS. (This means you can easily switch to different
            storage systems, instead of using the filesystem, just by sub-
            classing the OTDB::Storage class and overriding a few methods.)

            ==> IN OTHER NEWS: OT now uses the ZeroMQ library for transport!
            To learn more about OT's new transport capabilities, check out
            this guide:  http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all

   0.62 --- Load/SaveWallet uses the new Storage class. Dynamic casting
            was added to the storable objects. Pack/Unpack were debugged.
            Store/Query now supports plain strings. Contact ID was added.
            Storable objects now use smart pointers for internals.

   0.61 --- Added new Storage context class! Currently filesystem supported
            only, BUT you can now add any new storage you want simply by
            subclassing OTDB::Storage and implementing a few methods!! Many
            other storage methods can now quickly and easily be added.

            Furthermore, the Storage object was designed to make it easy to
            swap Packing libraries. OT now supports MsgPack IN ADDITION TO
            Google's Protobuf library. Soon these will also be used to
            clear up any binary incompatibilities between different
            systems running OT. (So the contracts will work on all systems
            equally.)

   0.60 --- Added password callback! Works in the API, in Java, etc.

   0.59 --- Fixed ANOTHER old bug in receipt verification.

   0.58 --- Added API stub for Import Nym

   0.57 --- Fixed an old bug in receipt verification.

   0.56 --- "Verify Last Signed Receipt against intermediary files" has
            officially been added to the API. Also added more ability to
            manipulate Tokens through the API. Also some debugging in 
            balance agreement (cleaned up an old bug that prevented
            transactions while certain receipt types were in the inbox.) 

   0.55 --- Minor release, goes along with Moneychanger (new Java GUI.)

   0.54 --- OT now stores the last 1024 logs internally, and makes them
            available via the API. Various other API debugging was done.

   0.53 --- API functions for Nym outbox, and for checking success status
            of a transaction message. Various other API fixes preparing
            for the upcoming test GUI.

   0.52 --- API functions for deleting Nyms, Accounts, and Contracts.

   0.51 --- API functions for Mail and Transactions.

   0.50 --- BASE-62-ENCODED IDs (much more compact.)

   0.45 --- Added a few API functions and updated the Windows build.

   0.44 --- RECEIPT VERIFICATION. Goes with the below change. Client-side
            receipts are now saved after every transaction, and whenever
            account/inbox/outbox files are downloaded, they're verified
            against the last signed receipt.

   0.43 --- BALANCE AGREEMENT / NO ACCOUNT HISTORY has been added!
            Just make sure you grab the outbox and inbox, and the account
            file, before doing a transaction, since they are needed
            for balance agreement, which is now operational and required.

   0.42 --- More bug fixes, plus added OT_API_CreateNym() (finally).

   0.41 --- Bug fixes in support of API, added various transaction
            types, receipt types, item types, to get full transfer
            receipt process working end-to-end.

   0.40 --- More additions to the API, plus many under-the-hood fixes.

   0.39 --- Continually updating the API based on developer feedback.

   0.38 --- Added Payment Plans, Markets, and Baskets to the API. Also
            added message buffer access to the API, so you can read all
            the server replies if you want to (or flush them...)

   0.37 --- Added build option DSP=1, for using custom builds of OpenSSL,
            and for turning off all the output logs.

   0.36 --- Top-level build targets added for API in Python, Ruby, PHP,
            and Perl!  It's now this easy to build the API:

            cd Open-Transactions
            make clean

           Then, from the same folder:

            make ruby
            make python
            make php5
            make perl5
     
           (More languages are supported, but for now these are the ones
           available at the top level.)    
 
   0.35 --- Huge additions to the API! See testwallet/OTAPI_funcdef.h
            for the complete interface, with NOTES above each function.
 
            That same interface is also wrapped by SWIG, and available
            in Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, Php, Lisp, etc, so those OTAPI
            functions are relevant to ALL developers...

            People have asked about documentation so hopefully the API,
            plus the notes within, will answer any questions for now
            until more professional docs can be written. As always, feel
            free to contact me with any questions.

            This release continues my push to make the library EASY and
            ACCESSIBLE to all developers, in all languages, on all
            platforms.  There are already multiple developers who are
            starting to play around with client software using the OTAPI,
            and I am very responsive to their needs.

            *** The latest SECURITY notes..

            ..Any new software requires testing with users AND peer review!
              Open Transactions was recently reviewed by Ben Laurie, and
              I accepted all the changes that he submitted. It's a good
              start!  This process must continue.

            ..In this release I have replaced all instances of strcpy
              with strlcpy/strcpy_s, and all instances of sprintf with
              snprintf/sprintf_s, and all instances of vsprintf with
              vsnprintf/vsprintf_s, and all instances of strcat with
              strlcat/strcat_s.  It's important to make sure there are no
              buffer overflows in this code.

            ..I also set up the code with Valgrind, and went through all
              the warnings, adding comments, fixes, and exclusions where
              appropriate or necessary. This process will continue, but
              it's important to run code scanners on this sort of software!
            
   0.34 --- (Various additions to the API at developer request.)
 
   0.33 --- Slicker build process. This release is all about having an
            EASY BUILD PROCESS, and is based on real-world feedback I've
            been getting from YOU, my testers: 

        *   For ALL users: XmlRpc++ is now part of the distribution,
            and is part of the build process. Various users had trouble
            installing this library separately, so I integrated it into
            the project. Now it's built-in! 

        *   For ALL users: Platform now auto-detected by MUCH easier/
            slicker Makefiles. 
            (And as with the last release, I was able to eliminate 
            several Makefiles.) To build (from main folder), just type: 

             make 

   (You may prefer 'make rpc', to build in the preferred XmlRpc mode.)

         *   To build the API: 
             cd testwallet; 
             make -f Makefile.API TRANSPORT=XmlRpc LANGUAGE=c 
             make -f Makefile.API TRANSPORT=XmlRpc LANGUAGE=ruby 
             make -f Makefile.API TRANSPORT=XmlRpc LANGUAGE=java 
             make -f Makefile.API TRANSPORT=XmlRpc LANGUAGE=python 
             make -f Makefile.API TRANSPORT=XmlRpc LANGUAGE=perl5 
             make -f Makefile.API TRANSPORT=XmlRpc LANGUAGE=php5 
             make -f Makefile.API TRANSPORT=XmlRpc LANGUAGE=lisp 
             Etc... 
             Slick, eh? In all the above cases, the platform is
             automatically detected. 
             See testwallet/API-README.txt for more notes. 

        *   For MAC users: The Makefiles had been using the wrong
            location for OpenSSL (at least, for the Macports 1.0.0a
            version) so I fixed this. The previous Makefiles referenced
            the default location, where (the wrong) version 0.9.8 can be
            found. (The new version looks in /opt, as used by MacPorts.) 

         *   For LINUX users: Now, OT attempts to link 64-bit libs where
             appropriate. 

         *   For FREEBSD users: The full new Makefile is now FULLY
             operational on FreeBSD, including the utilities
             "createmint.exe" and "signcontract.exe", which were
             previously unsupported on FreeBSD. 

  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   0.31 --- Native API, with easy Makefiles, added for C, C++, Objective-C,
            C#, Java, Lisp, Ruby, Python, Perl, PHP, and Tcl. Also
            supporting JRuby, Jython, and any other languages on the JVM. 

            Transport is now implemented as a CALLBACK FUNCTION, which
            means it is now VERY EASY to swap out to different forms of
            transport (though XmlRpc is probably the last form we'll ever
            need.)

  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   0.30 --- MAJOR RELEASE! Markets, Payment Plans, and OT as a Web Service!

          *** Open Transactions is now officially a WEB SERVICE! The
              server, client, and API now support *XML-RPC/HTTP*, in
              addition to the TCP/SSL mode from before. Open Transactions
              also now comes with an easy mechanism for substituting your
              own transport mechanism, using a callback function. (ALL
              transport protocols are welcome in Open Transactions...)

          *** Open Transactions now supports real MARKETS with full-
              featured 2-way trades! These markets can do LIMIT orders,
              STOP orders, DAY orders, FILL-OR-KILL orders, STOP LIMITS,
              etc. Markets also have SCALE, which means bulk pricing, and
              arbitrage.

          *** Open Transactions now supports PAYMENT PLANS. As long as both
              parties have signed the contract, the server will continue
              processing it according to its terms, placing receipts in the
              inboxes of the two parties until the payments are done.

          *** All data files were removed to a data folder, and all file
              paths were removed from data files (filenames are generated
              now, when needed.)  This all means datafiles are much easier
              now to work with.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   0.25 --- All file pointers were removed and replaced with C++ fstreams.
            
            An all new logging class, with errors, asserts, and multi-
            verbosity output. See the OTLog.h and .cpp files for more.
            (Centralizing the output and logging also helps porting
            efforts.)

            All the test certs were regenerated, and the contracts were
            re-signed, etc. This time they will last for 10 years, instead
            of 30 days. Slight fix to the Open-Transactions/ssl Makefile.

   0.24 --- FreeBSD working!

   0.23 --- Android version! (In support of our upcoming Android client.)
            UPDATE: this port is still ongoing, NOT perfect! Android has
            many custom things and limitations.

   0.22 --- EASY Makefiles and project files are now available for the
            JNI Java interface, as well as the high-level C++ API.
            
            Now it's easier than ever to use Open Transactions in your
            Java and C++ applications, for Mac, Linux, and Windows!

            Makefiles are supplied for MAC and LINUX, as well as project
            files for XCode on Mac and MS Visual C++ 2010 Express on
            Windows. 
 
            "FiatCash" (the first client, on Android) is humming along
            and hopefully we'll have some basic version soon up on Github.

            Negative transactions are no longer allowed for vouchers,
            account transfers, or cash withdrawals. They are still,
            however, allowed for cheques, which serve as invoices.

            Various global variable issues were cleaned up...

   0.21 --- Windows release!

           Open Transactions now supports Windows, LINUX, and Mac OS X.
           (In the same code base.)
           
           This distribution comes with gcc Makefiles for Mac and Linux,
           as well as XCode project files for Mac and Microsoft VC++
           project files for Windows.
           
           The Windows port was at the request of an Android developer who
           has begun work on a wallet (client app) that he calls
           "FiatCash".
           He will be building it on Windows, in Java, using the Open
           Transactions JNI interface to talk to the library. When
           complete, the wallet software will run on Android phones.
           
           INVOICES: Imagine that you hand someone an invoice. He runs it
           through his bank account and the money is automatically
           transferred to you, with receipts on both sides. This is the
           same thing as a cheque with a negative amount. Thus, "negative
           cheques" can be used as invoices. (Already operational.)
           
           Assorted:
           
           Many of the C Standard Library includes were replaced with their
           C++ standard library versions.
           
           Other cleanups were made including some fixes to OTString (which
           used to have some large stack-allocations) as well as a bug fix
           in the socket code for the server / test client.

           The client cert expired, so I re-created all the certs. If you
           have any problem with your own, just install the new version to
           fix it.
           
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   0.2 --- Major Release!  ALL NEW:

           JNI Interface (High-level Java API)

           High-level C++ Interface

           Spent Token Database is fully operational!

           Mints and Tokens now support Expiration AND Series. 

           New Financial Instruments: Cheques and Vouchers.

           Reserve accounts are now working to store the backing funds
           for cash withdrawals and vouchers (cashier's cheques.)

           Transaction numbers are fully working now.
           
           Nym files are now signed (to prevent tampering.)

           Hardcoding of paths was fixed, using config files and
           command-line arguments now, so you can use the software 
           without having to change the code.

           Path separators were improved to support Windows-style paths
           (though I haven't tried to actually build on Windows.)

           Numerous bug fixes. Including a big one: discarding
           token signature after unblinding.


// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  0.11 --- Added LINUX support... 

           Added Makefiles, and a few fixes related to Linux. 
           
           OT now runs on TWO platforms: LINUX and Mac OS X.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  0.1  --- The original goal was just proof-of-concept. There are many
           TODOs listed on the project page, as well as throughout the
           code.  But it all works!!!
		   
   A WARNING: This software is brand-spanking-new.  The project has not
yet been audited for security or tested for any extended period of time.
Thus far, it must be considered as for experimental purposes only.
		   
       --- There are still a few values that are hardcoded (in the client
           and the server), unfortunately, but it's all documented and I
           have everything set up already to run, so you don't have to
           mess with them. This will be fixed next release.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The server expects its OWN cert to be in the  transaction/certs folder.
The filename should be the server_user_ID from notaryServer.xml
(I HAVE ALREADY PLACED IT THERE.)

This is the file that includes the server's public AND private key.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
