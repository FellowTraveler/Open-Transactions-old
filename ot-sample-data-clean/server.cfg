;; CRON  (regular events like market trades and smart contract clauses)
;; refill_trans_number is the count of transaction numbers cron will grab for itself,
;; whenever its supply is getting low.  If it ever drops below 20% of this count
;; while in the middle of processing, it will put a WARNING into your server log.

;; ms_between_cron_beats is the number of milliseconds before Cron processes 
;; (all the trades, all the smart contracts, etc every 10 seconds.)

;; For sending:
;; blocking=true (usually not recommended) means OT will hang on the send/receive
;; call, and wait indefinitely until the send or receive has actually occurred.
;; IF BLOCKING IS FALSE (normal, default):
;; - no_tries is the number of times OT will try to send or receive a message.
;; - ms is the number of milliseconds it will wait between each attempt.
;; UPDATE: send_ms now DOUBLES after each failed attempt! (up to 5 tries)
;;
;; Server side values are quite different for recv_
;; 3 retries, and only 100 ms (which doubles 3 times if failure reading.)
