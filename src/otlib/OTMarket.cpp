// If I was ALREADY SELLING at $8, and a $10 bid came in, it would immediately process our orders and be done.
// If I was ALREADY BIDDING at $10, and an $8 ask came in, it would immediately process our orders and be done.
//
// So the question is, who gets WHAT price? Does the transaction occur at $8 or at $10? Do I get my price limit,
// or does he? Do you split the difference? I decided what to do... here is the REASONING, then CONCLUSION:
//
// REASONING:
//
// If I'm already selling for $8, and a $10 bid comes in, he's only going to choose me since I'm the lowest
// one on the market (and first in line for my price.) Otherwise he has no reason not to choose one of the
// others who are also available at that low price, instead of choosing me. The server would just pick
// whoever was next in line.
//
// And the other sellers also do have a right to get their sales completed, since they ARE willing to sell
// for $8. Obviously none of the other bids wanted me so far, even though I'm the best deal on my market,
// or I would have been snapped up already. But I'm still here. The bidder shouldn't pay more than fair market
// rate, which means more than whatever my competition is charging, and as long as I'm not getting any less
// than my own ask limit, then I HAVE agreed to the price, and it's fair. (I always could have set it higher.)
//
// The prices also were different when I came onto the market. Things were different then. Obviously
// since I'm still here, I wasn't ALWAYS the lowest price. Maybe in fact the price was $3 before, and I had a
// long-standing trade there that said not to sell for less than $8 (with a stop order too, so it didn't even
// activate until then.) THE POINT? I COULD have had the best price on the market THEN, whatever it was, simply
// by checking it and then setting my limit to match. But I didn't choose that. Instead, I set it to $8 limit,
// and then my trade sat there waiting for 6 months or god knows how long until it became valid, when market
// conditions became more favorable to my trade.
// THEN my trade, at some point, became the lowest price on the market (finally) so when someone's brand
// new $10 limit bid comes in, he ALSO deserves the best price on the market, just as I had the same
// opportunity to get the best price when *I* first entered the market. And since I am now first in line with
// $8 as the best price in the market, he should get it at that $8 price. We have both agreed to it! It is
// within BOTH of our limits! Notice we also BOTH got our fair shot up front to have the absolute best price,
// and instead we set our limit outside of what prices were available in order to wait for better offers.
//
//
// CONCLUSION:
//
// THEREFORE: The new Trade should always get the better deal in this function, in the sense that he gets
// the best price possible (the limit) from the other trade (that was already on the market.) And he gets the
// number-one best deal available from that side of the market. The existing trade does NOT get theOffer's
// limit price, but theOffer DOES get the other trade's limit price. This is how it should work. We are not
// going to "split the difference" -- although we might split a percentage off the difference as a server fee.
// I haven't thought that through yet (it's an idea suggested by Andrew Muck.)
