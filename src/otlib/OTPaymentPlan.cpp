	// Double-hmm, todo: I could make a series of macros for serializable member variables,
	// that would deal with all the xml read/write very compactly, and automatically track
	// whether the variable was dirty. Then anywhere in the code I can just ask an object
	// if it is dirty, or instruct it to update itself if it is.  Anyway, let's save Cron...

	// the entire cron file every time an item changes. That way the main cron file
	// can just keep a record of the active items, and will change only when an item
	// is added or removed.
	//
	// Until then, the entire Cron file will have to save EVERY time this call happens.
	//
	// (I'll add something to Cron so it can't save more than once per second or something.) 
	// (DONE: Payment Plans process hourly and Trades process every 10 seconds.)
