	How does this work?

	When trying to open a normal nym, the password callback realizes we are calling it 
	in "NOT master mode", so instead of just collecting the passphrase and giving it
	back to OpenSSL, it calls this function first, which returns the master password
	(so that IT can be given to OpenSSL instead.)

	If the master wasn't already loaded (common) then we call the callback in here ourselves.
	Notice it's recursive! But this time, the callback sees we ARE in master mode, so it doesn't
	call this function again (which would be an infinite loop.) Instead, it collects the password
	as normal, only instead of passing it back to the caller via the buffer, it uses the
	passUserInput by attaching it to thePWData before the call. That way the callback function
	can set passUserInput with whatever it retrieved from the user, and then back in this function
	again we can get the passUserInput and use it to unlock the MASTER passphrase, which we set
	onto theOutput.

	When this function returns true, the callback (0th level of recursion) uses theOutput
	as the "passphrase" for all Nyms, passing it to OpenSSL.

	This way, OpenSSL gets a random key instead of a passphrase, and the passphrase is just used
	for encrypting that random key whenever its timer has run out.
