    //          2. The UPDATED VERSION of that same cron item (a trade or payment plan) is stored in the ATTACHMENT on the OTItem member.
    //          3. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION is stored in the NOTE field of the OTItem member.

    // Unfortunately, marketReceipt doesn't adhere to this convention, as it stores the Updated Cron Item (the trade) in
    // the note instead of the attachment, and it stores the updated Offer (the additional info) in the attachment instead
    // of the note.
    // Perhaps this is for the best -- it will certainly kick out any accidental confusions between marketReceipt and finalReceipt!
    // todo: switch marketReceipt over to be like finalReceipt as described in this paragraph.
    //
    // Once everything is consistent on the above convention -- starting here and now with finalReceipt -- then we will ALWAYS 
    // be able to count on a Cron Item being in the Transaction Item's Attachment! We can load it using the existing factory class,
    // without regard to type, KNOWING it's a cron item every time.
