After building otcreatemint, place it in the transactions folder.
Whenever a new asset type is created (issued by a user) the server needs
to create the mint to go along with it. The problem is, the key generation takes
a long time -- so I put it in a separate process (otcreatemint.)

For now, after you issue an asset type, you need to run otcreatemint by hand
on the server side if you want to do withdrawals and deposits with that digital 
asset type.

In a future version, the server will fire off otcreatemint automatically whenever
an asset type is created. The user can then call getmint to get a copy of the file.
The call to getmint won't work right away (there will be a delay while the keys are
generated.) But after a while it WILL work, and then the user can grab the mint file,
and then he can make withdrawal requests in that asset type.





After building signcontract, put it in the testwallet folder if you want. You can
use it to sign ANY unsigned contract, with ANY Nym as long as you have the password.

You can also use the wallet to sign contracts.
